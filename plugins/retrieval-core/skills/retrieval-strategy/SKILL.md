# Retrieval Strategy

Pick a modality by **what you know about the query × what you know about the corpus.**

## Decision flow

- Know the exact token / regex / filename? → **lexical** (`rg`, `fd`)
- Know the code *shape*, not the text? → **structural** (`ast-grep`, `semgrep`)
- Querying JSON / YAML / config by schema? → **structured-data** (`jq`, `yq`, `gron`)
- Asking *when/why* something changed? → **history** (`git log -S/-G/-L`)
- Tabular data at scale (CSV/Parquet)? → **data files** (`duckdb`, `sqlite-utils`)
- Sizing / complexity of a codebase? → **metrics** (`tokei`, `scc`)
- Content inside PDFs / Office docs / archives? → **docs** (`rga`, `pandoc`)
- Only know the *meaning/intent*, or corpus is huge / unfamiliar / prose? → **semantic / RAG** (`local-rag`: `rag index` then `rag query`)
- Corpus is an Obsidian vault / link graph? → **graph** (`obsidian` bridge: graph/tags → `rag query --allowlist`). For authoring/Bases/Canvas use `kepano/obsidian-skills`.

Lexical/structural/structured-data/history/metrics/docs live in **code-search**.
Semantic and graph are available as the **local-rag** and **obsidian** plugins.

## Composition (modalities are layers, not rivals)

- **Hybrid rerank:** narrow with lexical/structured-data or the obsidian graph → pipe candidate file paths to `rag query --allowlist -` (turbovec reranks only those).
- **Scope then search:** graph backlinks narrow to a subgraph → RAG within it.
- **Find then pin:** RAG surfaces candidate regions → `rg` pins exact lines.

## Defaults

1. Start with the cheapest modality that fits (lexical is free and instant).
2. Narrow before widening; count matches (`rg -c`) before reading full output.
3. Escalate to semantic only when lexical/structural genuinely can't express the
   query (intent without known terms) or the corpus is too large/unfamiliar.
4. If a needed plugin (`local-rag`, `obsidian`) isn't installed, say so and
   suggest installing it — don't assume its tools exist.
5. If `rtk` is installed, prefix the rtk-wrapped commands (`rg`/`git`/`find`/
   `diff`) for compact output — it passes other tools through unchanged. (See
   the `code-search` plugin's rtk reference.)
