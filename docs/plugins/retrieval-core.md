# retrieval-core

!!! abstract "The spine"
    A `retrieval-strategist` agent and a `retrieval-strategy` decision-flow skill
    that pick and compose search modalities (lexical, structural, semantic/RAG,
    graph). Every other retrieval plugin builds on it.

`retrieval-core` is the routing layer of the marketplace. Given a question and a
corpus, it chooses the cheapest modality that answers it — and sequences several
together when one isn't enough.

## Install

=== "GitHub Copilot"

    ```bash
    copilot plugin marketplace add mbeacom/context-kit
    copilot plugin install retrieval-core@context-kit
    ```

=== "APM"

    ```bash
    apm marketplace add mbeacom/context-kit
    apm install retrieval-core@context-kit
    ```

=== "Claude Code"

    ```bash
    /plugin marketplace add mbeacom/context-kit
    /plugin install retrieval-core@context-kit
    ```

You usually get it for free: installing [`code-search`](code-search.md) or
[`verify`](verify.md) pulls `retrieval-core` in as a dependency.

## Components

| Component | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| **`retrieval-strategist`** agent | Picks and sequences retrieval modalities, including hybrid composition (lexical/structured narrows → vectors rerank). |
| **`retrieval-strategy`** skill | The decision-flow reference both the agent and humans use to choose a modality. |

## Choosing a modality

The decision flow keys off **what you already know** about the target:

| You know… | Reach for | Plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| an exact token, regex, or filename | lexical (`rg`, `fd`) | [code-search](code-search.md) |
| the code *shape*, not the literal text | structural (`ast-grep`, `semgrep`) | [code-search](code-search.md) |
| a JSON/YAML schema path | structured-data (`jq`, `yq`, `gron`) | [code-search](code-search.md) |
| *when / why* something changed | history (`git log -S/-G/-L`) | [code-search](code-search.md) |
| only the meaning / intent | semantic (RAG) | [local-rag](local-rag.md) |
| the corpus is an Obsidian vault | graph (backlinks / tags) | [obsidian](obsidian.md) |

## Composition is the point

Modalities are layers, not rivals. The strategist sequences them:

- **Hybrid rerank** — lexical or structured-data narrows to a candidate file set
  → `rag query --allowlist -` reranks only those by meaning.
- **Scope then search** — graph backlinks or tags bound a subgraph → RAG within it.
- **Find then pin** — RAG surfaces `path > heading` regions → `rg` pins exact lines.

See [Architecture](../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full modality model.
